This repository is designed to simplify the creation of AR projects. The intended users are employees of Covalent who may or may not have knowledge of programming languages. The following document will walk the user through the creation of a new project with the ability to do simple animations and link to other webpages.

## Sources and Thank Yous

First and foremost, thank you to Jerome Etienne for creating and maintaining AR.js. Without his active helping of the community and answering of questions I would have given up a long time ago. In addition thank you to all the people making tutorials and answering questions about AR.js without whom this would not be possible.
