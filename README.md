## Sources and Thank Yous

First and foremost, thank you to Jerome Etienne for creating and maintaining AR.js. Without his active helping of the community and answering of questions I would have given up a long time ago. In addition thank you to all the people making tutorials and answering questions about AR.js without whom this would not be possible.
